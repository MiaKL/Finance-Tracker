# Finance-Tracker
This Finance Tracker is an application for MacOS devices for keeping track of income and expenses in an organized environment with graphing capabilities to help visualize the rate of finance flow. After registering, any data added will be saved automatically upon logout so that one can return to it at any time. Features include creating data entries with customizable categories and subcategories to organize data, the option to delete existing entries, the ability to display all data or only data in a particular category, and the ability to graph all, or by category, income and expenses over time.

This assignment was a semester-long project for my Advanced C++ course at Bunker Hill Community College.
Documentation, including a User Story, User Guide, and UML Classes, is provided in the repository.
